# Mach-O Parser
This project includes simple C++ classes that can be used to parse and manipulate Mach-O binary files.

It should be compilable on most compilers (that support C++17 and up) and support most platforms. There are some MSVC specific intrinsics used, but they should be easily replaceable with ones supported by the target compiler.
